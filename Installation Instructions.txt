Detailed installation instructions:
------------------------------------------------
Conversion Pack v2.0 - W11 Fix / Installation (Steam Only)
------------------------------------------------

Most of the broken parts of these mods come down to broken batch files. They usually point to locations where steam used to save it's games, but it has changed since. The following instructions work on Windows 11 as of 4/27/2024:

1)	Run "ConvoPackInstaller.exe" from the Conversion Pack v2.0 Pack Moddb page. When prompted to set the download destination location, change it to the location that steam stores this game's GameData at. For me using W11 on Steam, it is at:
		C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Wars Battlefront II Classic\GameData

A terminal will come up wth several errors, one of which being "BattlefrontII.exe=BattlefrontII.exe" does not exist. This mod was last updated to work on Windows Vista, so several registry keys it looks for and the location of the EXE file are different and thus "not found".

	All that being said, you can ignore these errors and continue onward for now.

2) If you browse your local files on the game in steam, you should now see a couple of new folders under GameData. In the "GameData\v1.3patch" folder, there is a broken "menu.bat" batch file that needs to be replaced with my patched batch file. I have added comments within the batch file that you can take a look at if you want, but all it boils down to is adding a few checks here and there that adapt the script to how Windows11 does stuff for Steam.

3) Run this new "menu.bat" batch file and follow the on-screen prompt.
	Verify that the list of folders looks correct.
	Press 1 when prompted, to download the "UnOfficial v1.3 Patch", then 0 to exit.

Mod should now work once you launch the game! I'd still strongly recommend applying the "v1.3 Patch" patch, as it fixes some stuff & is easy to install.

UnOfficial v1.3 Patch r130 Installation
------------------------------------------------

4) Run the "SWBF2-v1.3patch-r130.exe" file with the install location being:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Wars Battlefront II Classic\

Mods should now work once you launch the game!


------------------------------------------------
Conversion Pack v2.2 Patch Installation
------------------------------------------------

5) Run the "ConPack2.2Patch.exe" file with the install location being:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Wars Battlefront II Classic\GameData


------------------------------------------------
KotOR Galactic Conquest Mod Installation 
------------------------------------------------

Conversion pack 2.0 + v1.3 patch are prerequisites to this.

This mod pack creates a folder named "KotORGC1" at the specified location, with subdirectories GameData\addon & GameData\DATA.
You can either choose your desktop (or anywhere else) as the destination & manually extract the relevant files to place them in the correct folders, or you can follow the steps here to fix it with my batch file.

6) Run the "KotORGC2.exe" file with the install location being:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Wars Battlefront II Classic

7) Run my "00_FixScript_SWBF2_KotORGC2.bat" batch file to automatically fix the error with where the installation process palces the files.
