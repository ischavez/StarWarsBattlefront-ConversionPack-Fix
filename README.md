# Star Wars Battlefront: Conversion Pack Fix [W11 Only] [WIP]


I tried running this mod after downloading it from MOD DB (link below), but it didn't work with Windows 11. I patched it to load the files and startup the game correctlty, so I'm sharing it here.

Originally this was just a fix to the base mod pack, but it has turned more into a repository with quick links & easy instructions / fixes to all of the conversion pack mods, patches, and additions.

Here is a list of all the mods addressed in this repo:

	- Conversion Pack v2.0 Mod
	- UnOfficial v1.3 Patch r130
	- Conversion Pack v2.2 Patch
	- KotOR Galactic Conquest Mod

I'll be adding a text file with explanations of the fixes for those curious. This project is a work in progress. (CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS FOR W11)

Checkout the "Installation Instructions.txt" file for both detailed installation instructions & a TLDR.

Progress:
- Conversion Pack v2.0 Clean Installation (Steam Only)			[DONE]
- Conversion Pack v2.0 Clean Uninstallation (Steam Only)		[WIP]
- Conversion Pack v2.0 Clean Full Menu functionality			[WIP]
- UnOfficial v1.3 Patch r130 Installation						[DONE]
- Conversion Pack v2.2 Patch Installation 						[DONE]
- KotOR Galactic Conquest Mod Installation + Fix 				[DONE]

I do not take ownership of any of these mod packs. All links to the original files are listed in their respective section below.

Conversion Pack v2.0 (ConvoPackInstaller.exe) [WIP - Need to get clarity on which maps are added due to v2.0 / v2.2 / v1.3 patch?]
------------------------------------------------

	This is the base Star wars Battlefront Conversion Pack v2.0 mod originally uploaded on Sep 21st, 2008.
	It looks like this exe includes the v1.3 patch

	"The Conversion Pack is a comprehensive add-on to the original Battlefront II. It adds 25 new maps - including all of the maps from Battlefront 1 not originally featured in Battlefront 2, 5 new gamemodes, a new era, and a substantial amount of expanded unit content to the original game."

	25 maps:
		1.		Alderaan
		2.		Bespin: Cloud City		SWBF1

		1.		Deathmatch
		2.		Hero CTF
		3.		Holocron
		4.		King of the Hill
		5.		Order 66

				Assault was renamed to Hero Assault / Space Assault
				Campaign missions are also available
				Classic Conquest is similar to Conquest from SWBF1
				
	New era:
		1.		KotOR

	Unit Content:(WIP - I'm assuming this is just all the hunt units / KotOR units added)

	Verify correct installation by:
		Opening instant action & confirming that Alderaan is the first map available. If so, I presume that all the other maps have been added also.
