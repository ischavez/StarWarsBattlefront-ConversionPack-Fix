# Star Wars Battlefront: Conversion Pack Fix [W11 Only] [WIP]


I tried running this mod after downloading it from MOD DB (link below), but it didn't work with Windows 11. I patched it to load the files and startup the game correctlty, so I'm sharing it here.

I'll be adding a text file with explanations of the fixes for those curious. This project is a work in progress. (CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS FOR W11)


Progress:
- Conversion Pack v2.0 Clean Installation (Steam Only)			[DONE]
- Conversion Pack v2.0 Clean Uninstallation (Steam Only)		[WIP]
- Conversion Pack v2.0 Clean Full Menu functionality			[WIP]
- UnOfficial v1.3 Patch r130 Installation						[DONE]
- Conversion Pack v2.2 Patch Installation 						[DONE]
- KotOR Galactic Conquest Mod Installation + Fix 				[DONE]
